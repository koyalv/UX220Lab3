    <p>The best movie that I have seen is a romantic comedy called Set It Up</p>
    <p>This is one of my favourite movies because it shows the two interns who fake a relationship for their bosses to ensure that they have their own lives. The movie follows them in this journey and even though it does not seem like it in the beginning of the movie they fall in love at the end</p>
